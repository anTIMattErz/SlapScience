# CloutScraper

## Summary
Personal project to explore data collection, analysis, and visualization by webscraping data on songs posted to SoundCloud.com. To do this, I will be using Beautiful Soup and Selenium to collect statitcs for songs of a growing catalogue of artists. Ultimately, I will be tracking plays, comments, and reposts over time, using these features to gauge traction on the platform and forecast whether a track is going to be the next viral hit before it reaches the masses.
