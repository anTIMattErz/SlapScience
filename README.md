# CloutScraper

## Summary
Personal project to explore data collection, analysis, and visualization by webscraping data on songs posted to SoundCloud.com. To do this, I will be using Beautiful Soup and Selenium to collect statitcs for songs of a growing catalogue of artists. Ultimately, I will be tracking plays, comments, and reposts over time, using these features to gauge traction on the platform and forecast whether a track is going to be the next viral hit before it reaches the masses.

## Web-scraping Methodology
To scrape data for tracks over time through artists pages, it is necessary to collect artist urls and then iterate over them. That said, before being able to collect information on plays, comments, likes, and reposts per song, I had to find repositories of artists' urls that I could scrape. By scraping playlists, I was able to generate a growing catalogue of artists and their links.
